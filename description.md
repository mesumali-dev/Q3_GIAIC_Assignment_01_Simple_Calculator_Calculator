# Calculator Script Description

This project consists of a simple Python calculator script (`calculator.py`) that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## `calculator.py`

This script prompts the user to select an operation (1 for add, 2 for subtract, 3 for multiply, 4 for divide) and then to enter two numbers. It then performs the selected operation on the two numbers and prints the result.

### Functions:
- `add(x, y)`: Returns the sum of x and y.
- `subtract(x, y)`: Returns the difference of x and y.
- `multiply(x, y)`: Returns the product of x and y.
- `divide(x, y)`: Returns the quotient of x and y. Handles division by zero by returning an error message.

## How to Run:
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script from your terminal: `python calculator.py`
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to choose an operation and enter numbers.

Oh, nature's embrace, a tranquil delight,
With mountains so grand, and stars shining bright.
The rivers that flow, with a gentle soft gleam,
A vibrant green world, like a beautiful dream.

The birds sing their songs, a sweet melody,
While trees sway and dance, wild and free.
In every small bloom, a wonder we find,
The artistry of nature, so pure and so kind.
